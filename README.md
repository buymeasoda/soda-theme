You can locate your Sublime Text `Packages` directory by using the menu item `Preferences -> Browse Packages...`.

While inside the `Packages` directory, clone the theme repository using the command below:

    git clone https://github.com/electricgraffitti/soda-solarized-dark-theme "Theme - Soda SolarizedDark SolarizedDark"


## Activating the theme
